# Q-Astro-Dew-Monitor
Q- Astro Dew Monitor for a max of 2 dew heaters

You can find details about this Dew Monitor on my website: https://www.q-astro.com/#/ascom-auto-dew-monitor/

For a version history you can have a look at the VersionHistory.txt file.

Version 4.1.0 is released. For this release you need to update the Arduino code as well.

You can communicate directly with the Arduino on the board (e.g. using puTTY) and the following commands are available to you:
* i# - This return what it is and its version number.
* oz# - This return all available data in a single string. This is what the ASCOM driver uses.
    - a = Altitude
    -	d = Dew Point (in Celsius)
    -	ex = x either 1 or 2, gives you the temp of either Dew Band 1 or 2 (in Celsius)
    -	h = Humidity (%)
    -	i = last update time
    -	m = What is the mode of the Dew Monitor (0 = Auto, 1 = Manual)
    -	p = Pressure
    -	ox = The power supplied to either Dew Band 1 or 2 (x=1 or 2) in %
    -	t = Observatory temp
*	om# - This gives you the status if the Dew Heater is in Auto or Manual mode (0 = Auto & 1 = Manual).
*	omx# - Where x can be 0 or 1, this sets the Dew Heater to either Manual (1) or Auto (0)
*	ooxyyy# - Where x can be 1 or 2, for the dew band selected and yyy is the power percentage you want to apply to the dew band (0 â€“ 100%). This only works when the Dew Monitor is in manual mode (m=1).
*	oox# - Where x can be 1 or 2 and will return the current power (in %) applied to the requested dew band.
