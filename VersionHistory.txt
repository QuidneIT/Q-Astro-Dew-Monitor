Verion Log:

Date	    Who	Vers	Description
----------  ---	-----	-------------------------------------------------------
05-02-2019  RvE	1.0.0	Initial edit, created from ASCOM driver template and first release of a working driver.
17-02-2019  RvE 1.5.0   Added functionality to permanently switch on display. Also be able to recognise that the correct Firmware is running on the Arduino.
31/08/2019  RvE 2.0.0	Complete rewrite of the LocalServer ASCOM code.
04/12/2019  RvE 2.0.1	Resolve setup bug when using the Dew Management App
21/01/2020  RvE 2.1.0	Show Pressure in hPa in UI
02/02/2021  RvE 3.0.0	Redesign of Arduino software and ASCOM drivers. More simplification of the code.
						Change of name for the ASCOM code to Q-Astro Monitor as the system is self managing.
						First release available on GitHub
22-09-2021  RvE 3.0.1	Fix problem in Arduino & GUI code as Dew Heater Power was not shown correctly.
28-01-2022  RvE 3.0.1 & 3.0.2 Arduino Added Timer library to Required Library folder and remove Q-Astro-BMA library. Updated the Arduino code to fix Timer bug 
						and to allow for BM280 I2C Address to be defined (See ObservingConditions.ino).
18-10-2022	RvE 3.5.0	Updated the Arduino Code to fix incorrect initialisation of Dew Bands and temp sensors.
						Using latest Libraries.
						Added base code for future function to set the Dew Monitor in manual mode which will enable you to set the dew band power manually
						Overal code cleanup where possible
21-10-2022	RvE 4.0.0	Updated the IU to incorporate the new function to manual set the Dew Power on the Dew Bands.
						Code made more resilient to errors.
						Added more status updates.
29-10-2022	RvE 4.0.1	Resolve Bug where Dew Bands had power applied (Auto mode) and then switch to manual, caused String Conversion error.
31-10-2022	RvE 4.0.5	Update Arduino code to detect if OLED present or not. 
						Change code to properly act on OLED present or not.
						Remove EPROM library & code as it was not used.
03-11-2022  RvE 4.0.6	Added feature requested by Herb Steck to move the trackbars to the Power level used when in Auto mode.
05-11-2022	RvE 4.1.0	Resolved bug with Arduino ASCOM update time
						Fix Bug in ASCOM driver to return proper LastTimeUpdate in sec.
						Monitor App update to show current time and latest Sensor update time.				
06-11-2022	RvE 4.1.1	Optimize Monitor App code. Resolve Connect/Disconnect bugs.
						Resolve bug switching from Manual to Auto mode and Dew Monitor not updating.
21-11-2022	RvE 4.1.5	Change the ASCOM driver to implement Action() & CustomActions()
						Added feature requested by Herb Steck to disconnect the Monitor App if no Sensor Updates have been received for 2 min.
						Fix in Arduino code as Get Dew Heater temp is the e# command and not the w# commmand.
						Fix bug in Arduino code where power set in Manual mode would either be 100% or 0% and nothing inbetween.
						Fix bug to enable trace in Setup Dialog.
22-12-2022	RvE 4.2.0	Many updates to the internal code of the:
						* Arduino Code 
							- Changed the startup process. Delay the start of the power to the dew bands if Dew Bands need power upon startup due to low temps.
							- Changed pressure data requested from p to b.
							- Consolidated get & set dewband power to p.
							- Added some additional Serial data output during initialisation.
						* ASCOM Driver
							- Completely changed the way data is requested from the Arduino. Removed the consolidated data request timed function to individual requests. 
							- Fixed a long standing bug where the driver did not notice a disconnect from the Arduino.
							- Added more error checking.
							- Properly implemented TimeSinceLastUpdate function.
							- Implemented the Refresh function.
						* Monitor App
							- Updated the Data Request process to a seperate function.

10-01-2023 RvE 4.3.0	Moved from a BME280 to a SHT31. Big difference is that the SHT31 does not record Altitude or Pressure. These 2 parameters have been removed from the
						Arduino code, ASCOM Driver & Monitor App.
						Additional code cleaning as some duplication of actions where found in the Monitor-App.
						All the code related to the BME280 has only been commented out in this version.
						Added icon to Start-Menu -> Programs
10-01-2023 RvE 4.3.1	Added cleanResponse() to the SharedResources.cs to clean the response incase of any corruption in the serial stream.
						Arduino code updated to add a o to the response when performing an i# request.

15-03-2023 RvE 4.5.0	Removed dll usb_relay_device.dll from the DewMonitor-App Resources as this is not used at all and is legacy code from a different project.
						Remove #define MAX_DEWHEATERS 2 from the Arduino code as this is not used anymore.
						Updated Driver.cs & SharedResources.cs to better implement Connect/Disconnect.
						Updated Driver.cs & SharedResources.cs to better detect hardware disconnect.
						Updated Monitor App for better error handling.
						Arduino Code update for a more detailed Dew Point calculation.
						Arduino Rewrite of the Dew Management code to enable a more stable power use.

FYI: The code is not perfect, by a long shot. But it is more stable than before.
