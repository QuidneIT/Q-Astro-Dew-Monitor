Verion Log:

Date	    Who	Vers	Description
----------  ---	-----	-------------------------------------------------------
05-02-2019  RvE	1.0.0	Initial edit, created from ASCOM driver template and first release of a working driver.
17-02-2019  RvE 1.5.0   Added functionality to permanently switch on display. Also be able to recognise that the correct Firmware is running on the Arduino.
31/08/2019  RvE 2.0.0	Complete rewrite of the LocalServer ASCOM code.
04/12/2019  RvE 2.0.1	Resolve setup bug when using the Dew Management App
21/01/2020  RvE 2.1.0	Show Pressure in hPa in UI
02/02/2021  RvE 3.0.0	Redesign of Arduino software and ASCOM drivers. More simplification of the code.
				Change of name for the ASCOM code to Q-Astro Monitor as the system is self managing.
				First release available on GitHub
22-09-2021  RvE 3.0.1	Fix problem in Arduino & GUI code as Dew Heater Power was not shown correctly.
28-01-2022  RvE 3.0.1 & 3.0.2 Arduino Added Timer library to Required Library folder and remove Q-Astro-BMA library. Updated the Arduino code to fix Timer bug 
				and to allow for BM280 I2C Address to be defined (See ObservingConditions.ino).
18-10-2022	RvE 3.5.0	Updated the Arduino Code to fix incorrect initialisation of Dew Bands and temp sensors.
				Using latest Libraries.
				Added base code for future function to set the Dew Monitor in manual mode which will enable you to set the dew band power manually
				Overal code cleanup where possible
21-10-2022	RvE 4.0.0	Updated the IU to incorporate the new function to manual set the Dew Power on the Dew Bands.
				Code made more resilient to errors.
				Added more status updates.
				
FYI: The code is not perfect, by a long shot. But it is more stable than before.
