ASCOM Environment driver for Q-Astro Dew Monitor
To be used with Q-Astro Dew Management Arduino Code
Description:	Q-Astro Dew Monitor driver is part of a LocalServer ASCOM Solution 
		which uses an Arduino NANO board to control Environment through a single communication channel(USB Cable)

Implements:	ASCOM Q-Astro Dew Monitor interface version : 3.0.0

Verion Log:

Date	    Who	Vers	Description
----------  ---	-----	-------------------------------------------------------
05-02-2019  RvE	1.0.0	Initial edit, created from ASCOM driver template and first release of a working driver.
17-02-2019  RvE 1.5.0   Added functionality to permanently switch on display. Also be able to recognise that the correct Firmware is running on the Arduino.
31/08/2019  RvE 2.0.0	Complete rewrite of the LocalServer ASCOM code.
04/12/2019  RvE 2.0.1	Resolve setup bug when using the Dew Management App
21/01/2020  RvE 2.1.0	Show Pressure in hPa in UI
02/02/2021  RvE 3.0.0	Redesign of Arduino software and ASCOM drivers. More simplification of the code.
						Change of name for the ASCOM code to Q-Astro Monitor as the system is self managing.
						First release available on GitHub
22-09-2021  RvE 3.0.1	Fix problem in Arduino & GUI code as Dew Heater Power was not shown correctly.
28-01-2022  RvE 3.0.1 & 3.0.2 Arduino Added Timer library to Required Library folder and remove Q-Astro-BMA library. Updated the Arduino code to fix Timer bug 
						and to allow for BM280 I2C Address to be defined (See ObservingConditions.ino).
18-10-2022	RvE 3.5.0	Updated the Arduino Code to fix incorrect initialisation of Dew Bands and temp sensors.
						Using latest Libraries.
						Added base code for future function to set the Dew Monitor in manual mode which will enable you to set the dew band power manually
						Overal code cleanup where possible
21-10-2022	RvE 4.0.0	Updated the IU to incorporate the new function to manual set the Dew Power on the Dew Bands.
						Code made more resilient to errors.
						Added more status updates.
29-10-2022	RvE 4.0.1	Resolve Bug where Dew Bands had power applied (Auto mode) and then switch to manual, caused String Conversion error.
31-10-2022	RvE 4.0.5	Update Arduino code to detect if OLED present or not. 
						Change code to properly act on OLED present or not.
						Remove EPROM library & code as it was not used.
03-11-2022  RvE 4.0.6	Added feature requested by Herb Steck to move the trackbars to the Power level used when in Auto mode.
05-11-2022	RvE 4.1.0	Resolved bug with Arduino ASCOM update time
						Fix Bug in ASCOM driver to return proper LastTimeUpdate in sec.
						Monitor App update to show current time and latest Sensor update time.				
06-11-2022	RvE 4.1.1	Optimize Monitor App code. Resolve Connect/Disconnect bugs.
						Resolve bug switching from Manual to Auto mode and Dew Monitor not updating.
21-11-2022	RvE	4.1.5	Change the ASCOM driver to implement Action() & CustomActions()
						Added feature requested by Herb Steck to disconnect the Monitor App if no Sensor Updates have been received for 2 min.
						Fix in Arduino code as Get Dew Heater temp is the e# command and not the w# commmand.
						Fix bug in Arduino code where power set in Manual mode would either be 100% or 0% and nothing inbetween.
						Fix bug to enable trace in Setup Dialog.

Still to be fixed:
* When Dew Monitor disapears (due to USB disconnect) the ASCOM driver to not act correctly and continue to think it is connected.


FYI: The code is not perfect, by a long shot. But it is more stable than before.
